# Accelorometer

A basic app that shows the acceleration of the object as it moves.I have also added a delta condition as to which if a threshold is reached, you can modify the method according to you needs and perform a task.

The simple trick here is that the delta function should be optimal enough such that a simple movement of the phone does not cause unintented actions. However, it should not be very huge that it required too much strength from the users' side in order for them to participate.

This was done as a part of a bigger project called Shake it, in which upon the user shaking the phone with certain strength can ask questions as an interaction Question-Answer session.
